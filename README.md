# BlastBomber-Game

## Description
Blast Bomber is a project done to complete my grade in the subject called "Computer graphics (Kompjuterska grafika - KGR)" on the Faculty of Information technologies in Mostar. It was a joint effort from my colleague Karabeg Naida and I to recreate a 1985 game called "Bomberman" in a 3D world, along with some character and gameplay modifications.

The game is still very buggy and needs a lot of code cleanup, but it shows some of the basic concepts we learned on the subject and on our own.
